    <h2>Tottenham Hotspur and the English Premier League</h2>
    <p>
        Tottenham Hotspur are a professional soccer team located in London, England and are a part of the English
        Premier League or "Prem".
        In this league there are some of the top teams throughout the entire world such as Manchester City,
        Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, and of course
        Tottenham Hotspur as well. Amongst these top teams there are fifteen others which all together, complete
        the roster for the league. In many cases people
        exclude Tottenham from being categorized as an "elite" or "top" team in the world but being a Tottenham
        supporter myself I find this
        not to be the case. Although my club have not had the best luck in regards to winning any major titles
        or trophies they are still a
        prominent team in the league and deserve the respect of soccer fans around the world. Below this you
        will be able to find more information about Tottenham like their 
        <a href="roster.html"> roster </a> as well as their <a href="rivals.html">rival</a>.
